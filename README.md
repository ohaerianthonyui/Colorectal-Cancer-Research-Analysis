# Colorectal-Cancer-Research-Analysis


Colorectal Cancer Risk & Survival Research Analysis 

Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to explore the factors associated with colorectal cancer outcomes using the provided dataset. This analysis will help healthcare professionals understand the risk factors, treatment access, and factors that contribute to survival and recurrence in patients.


The research is going to be based off these research questions:

### General Patient Demographics:

What is the distribution of patients across different ages, genders, and races?

What is the geographic distribution of patients based on region (urban vs. rural)?

How many patients have a family history or a previous cancer history?

### Stage and Tumor Characteristics:

What is the distribution of cancer stage at diagnosis across the dataset?

How does tumor aggressiveness vary with different stages of cancer?

### Lifestyle and Health Factors:

What is the distribution of dietary patterns (e.g., diet type) among patients?

How does BMI (Body Mass Index) correlate with the stage of cancer at diagnosis?

How active are patients in terms of physical activity levels?

What proportion of patients are smokers and how does smoking status affect cancer progression?

How does alcohol consumption correlate with cancer risk or survival rates?

What is the level of red meat consumption and its association with colorectal cancer incidence?

What is the fiber consumption distribution among patients?

### Screening and Diagnosis:

How does colonoscopy access correlate with early detection and stage at diagnosis?

What is the frequency of regular cancer screenings across different socioeconomic and geographic groups?

How much time does it take for patients to receive a diagnosis after the onset of symptoms?

### Insurance and Treatment Access:

How does insurance coverage affect treatment access, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery?

What are the treatment patterns (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) across different stages of cancer?

What is the proportion of patients receiving each treatment type?

### Outcomes: Survival and Recurrence:

What is the survival rate across different stages of cancer?

How does the time to diagnosis impact survival outcomes?

What is the relationship between treatment access (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) and survival rates?

How do patients' adherence to follow-up affect their survival rate?

What is the recurrence rate, and how does it relate to treatment types or patient demographics?

How long does it take for patients to experience cancer recurrence after treatment?


### Summary of Findings:

1. **Smoking Status and Cancer Stages:**
   - Individuals who have never smoked represent the highest proportion across all cancer stages, suggesting that smoking status may influence cancer risk and stage at diagnosis.

2. **Colonoscopy Access:**
   - Patients with access to colonoscopy had higher cancer detection rates across various stages compared to those without access, emphasizing the importance of screening for early cancer detection.

3. **Socioeconomic Factors and Screening:**
   - Middle-class patients residing in urban areas are more likely to engage in regular cancer screening, highlighting the influence of socioeconomic status and geographic location on access to preventive care.

4. **Insurance Coverage and Treatment:**
   - Patients with insurance coverage generally receive more comprehensive and effective treatment, underscoring the significant role that insurance plays in improving access to necessary healthcare services.

5. **Stage of Cancer and Treatment Outcomes:**
   - Patients diagnosed with Stage I and II cancer tend to receive better treatment and have higher survival rates compared to those diagnosed at later stages. Early detection and intervention are key factors in successful treatment outcomes.

6. **Adherence to Follow-Up Care:**
   - Patients who adhered to follow-up care had higher survival rates, reinforcing the importance of continuous monitoring and timely interventions for improving long-term outcomes.

7. **Low Recurrence Rate:**
   - The recurrence rate among most patients was low, suggesting that current treatment protocols are effective in preventing cancer from returning after initial treatment.

### Recommendations:

1. **Enhance Screening Access and Awareness:**
   - Expanding access to cancer screening, especially colonoscopy, in underserved areas and among high-risk populations can lead to earlier detection and better outcomes. Efforts should be made to raise awareness of the importance of regular screening.

2. **Improve Healthcare Accessibility:**
   - Policies should focus on increasing healthcare access for middle-class and rural populations, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or location, can access preventive services like cancer screenings.

3. **Strengthen Insurance Coverage:**
   - Expanding insurance coverage for uninsured or underinsured patients can improve access to comprehensive treatment and enhance cancer care outcomes. Addressing healthcare disparities through better insurance options should be a priority.

4. **Focus on Early Detection and Treatment:**
   - Early detection and intervention remain critical in improving survival rates. Strategies should focus on improving early-stage cancer diagnoses, particularly for patients who are at lower risk (e.g., non-smokers).

5. **Encourage Follow-Up Care Compliance:**
   - Public health campaigns and healthcare providers should emphasize the importance of regular follow-up care, as adherence to these appointments significantly contributes to improved survival rates and better long-term outcomes.

6. **Monitor Long-Term Recurrence Rates:**
   - Continued research and surveillance are needed to understand recurrence patterns and improve treatments to further reduce recurrence rates, ensuring that patients with advanced cancer stages also receive effective care.

By focusing on these areas, it is possible to improve cancer detection, treatment, and outcomes for a wider range of patients.
